<h1>Clack Clack Clack</h1>

<pre>
<span class="line-number">1</span> Today’s Fergus lives under a low ceiling
<span class="line-number">2</span> in his indistinct spec home
<span class="line-number">3</span> in an under-engineered neighborhood
<span class="line-number">4</span> where property is a <a href=<"Doesn’t Make Sense at First.html">pervasive concept</a>.

<span class="line-number">5</span> Clack clack clack clangs against pressboard walls.
<span class="line-number">6</span> Blue light permeates the windows to his mythical soul.
<span class="line-number">7</span> Opera like glass, unperceived and fragile, sings his purpose
<span class="line-number">8</span> to dust bunnies breeding in the corners of his life.

<span class="line-number">9</span> Clack clack clacking comes from his fingers.
<span class="line-number">10</span> His eyelids are curtains held up with duct tape.
<span class="line-number">11</span> Still-speaking slack jaw narrates his streaming dream aloud
<span class="line-number">12</span> to cluttered room buzzing with artificial power.

<span class="line-number">13</span> Pinned down to his seat
<span class="line-number">14</span> Fergus slumps into his fate
<span class="line-number">15</span> as oil presses through the massive gears of an engine —
<span class="line-number">16</span> spineless.
