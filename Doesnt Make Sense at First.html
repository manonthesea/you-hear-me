    <h1>It’s Okay if it Doesn’t Make Sense at First</h1>
    <pre>
<span class="line-number">1</span> Close your eyes, and I will whisper silly things to you.
<span class="line-number">2</span> Fall asleep as my words become a moving picture reel:
<span class="line-number">3</span> framed images of <a href="Nostalgia.html">puppies</a> running down the hall,
<span class="line-number">4</span> talk of things you’ve never heard before,
<span class="line-number">5</span> nonsense to release you
<span class="line-number">6</span> from this world through <a href="Now Madness.html">semblance</a>.

<span class="line-number">7</span> The hint of understanding in the eyes of a child settles upon the scene,
<span class="line-number">8</span> which may not make sense upon the mind immediately,
<span class="line-number">9</span> but deep down in your <a href="The Party Inside.html">fever dreams</a>,
<span class="line-number">10</span> you hear me, right?

<h2>...</h2>

<span class="line-number">11</span> In the flashes and glimpses of your REM state,
<span class="line-number">12</span> your <a href="Muddled Soup">synapses</a> tell you, you and I are not 1s and 0s;
<span class="line-number">13</span> there is a third, of whom simply to speak is radical.
<span class="line-number">14</span> I’ve brought you here to tell you this.

<span class="line-number">15</span> When I say these things you can only comprehend in your sleep,
<span class="line-number">16</span> you may see me walking around with my head to the ground
<span class="line-number">17</span> grunting like an old hound following a lost trail,
<span class="line-number">18</span> but you will try to follow me, no?

<h2>...</h2>

<span class="line-number">19</span> <a href="Four%20Scenes%20from%20the%20Park.html">The scene</a> becomes a stage made for tin boxes making tin boxes
<span class="line-number">20</span> where the subconscious displays on a blue screen.
<span class="line-number">21</span> These machines are punitive,
<span class="line-number">22</span> stealing dreams in the most pervasive sense,
<span class="line-number">23</span> constraining tomorrow into a squirming box
<span class="line-number">24</span> of insectile click and non-stop clack.

<span class="line-number">25</span> I wish I could tell you something to calm your fears
<span class="line-number">26</span> except to insist you read between the lines.

<span class="line-number">27</span> You understand me, now?

<h2>...</h2>

<span class="line-number">28</span> Squeezed into our boxes, still you pick up what I’m putting down
<span class="line-number">29</span> that which transcends the staged walls,
<span class="line-number">30</span> for you and I are in the world but not of it;
<span class="line-number">31</span> we’ve been freed by our language,
<span class="line-number">32</span> yet our eternal creation turns our semantics against us.

<span class="line-number">33</span> The bots are reading your thoughts,
<span class="line-number">34</span> but our prophetic vision is beyond them,
<span class="line-number">35</span>     //so they comment it out
<span class="line-number">36</span> They will never get me,
<span class="line-number">37</span> but you will, will you not?

<span class="line-number">38</span> Friend, who spends their days with bound books,
<span class="line-number">39</span> revel in the space we’ve together; let me tell you
<span class="line-number">40</span> we are just starting to talk the <a href="Summer Storm">quantum profound</a>
<span class="line-number">41</span> of <span class="italic">being-in-language</span>, that little light inside of <span class="italic">being-called</span>.
<span class="line-number">42</span> Do you hear me yet, <a href="https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/giorgio-agamben-the-coming-community"><span class="italic">Coming Community?</span></a>
